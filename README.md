# SHADOWFOX-TASKS-INTERMEDIATE-
🚀 Interactive Pollution Data Dashboard 📊 This project visualizes air pollution trends using real-time datasets. It analyzes daily pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10) and generates clean, exportable graphs for reports or awareness. Built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Jupyter.
# 🌍 Interactive Pollution Data Dashboard

This project visualizes air pollution trends using real-time datasets. Built in **Python with Jupyter Notebook**, it calculates and displays daily averages of key pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10. It allows users to analyze trends interactively and **exports graphs** for LinkedIn, GitHub reports, or public awareness.
